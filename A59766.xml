         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>And becauſe Doctrine without Practice is but a Body of Religion without a Soul to quicken it; I have here added <hi>a Summary of Chriſtian Practice,</hi> in the inſuing <hi>Rules of Self-examination,</hi> which will equally diſcover unto you your Sins and Miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges paſt, and ſerve for a Guide to direct you in the future ordering of all the Actions of your lives in the ways of Godlineſs.</p>
                  <p>In both which Summaries I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be both brief and plain, delivering onely what I conceive generally neceſſary to Salvation, and expreſſing the ſame in the moſt eaſy way to be underſtood: as knowing that multitude of words, various, acute, and quaint affected expreſſions, eſpecially in the Eſſentials of Religion, though they may more pleaſe, do not ſo much profit, nay, they do really rather diſtract then inſtruct the minds of moſt. For it is not the rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling of the Leaves, but the Fruits of the Tree of knowledge that feed the Soul to life eternall.</p>

                  <p>The Praiers preſcribed upon any the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing conſiderations are not by way of one long continued Oration without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; but divided into ſeverall ſhorter Praiers: and this becauſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> The heat of holy Zeal is hereby better maintained, and kept flaming in the Soul, whilſt the ending of one Praier and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning another adds new fervour to the Soul's Devotion.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> Long Praiers do tire the ſpirits, clog the memory, diſtract the mind, and damp that celeſtiall fervour which is the life of all holy and acceptable Praiers.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> Such are all thoſe Praiers which are truly the Praiers of God's Holy Spirit, and ſtand upon record in Holy Writ: they are all divided and cut ſhort into ſo many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Verſes, as into ſo many ſeveral ſhorter Praiers.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> Thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> has commanded us to pray, <hi>Matt. 6.7, 8, 9.</hi> And according to this patern the Praiers of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Church, even for the length thereof, are generally fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                  <p>My primary intention in the inſuing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was chiefly, to direct you for the

                  <p>And being deſired to inlarge my Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon that Bleſſed Sacrament, I have therefore now divided the former Edition into Two Parts: the Firſt, of <hi>Self-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi> and the Second, of <hi>the Holy Communion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherein I muſt neceſſarily tell you, that ſince the Danger of <hi>unworthy</hi> Receiving is equivalent with the Benefit of the <hi>worthy;</hi> it therefore concerns every one of you, that hath any ſenſe and ſincere care of his Soul's health, as ſtrictly to <hi>examine himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup,</hi> as he believes he ſhall be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before the great Tribunal of Heaven; and accordingly to purge and purify his Soul by Confeſſion, Contrition, and all the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Acts and Offices of true Repentance; the practice whereof is in the following Leaves delivered.</p>
                  <p>Of the other Two Parts of <hi>the Practical Chriſtian,</hi> mentioned in the general Title-page, you will have a farther account in the <hi>Preface</hi> thereunto.</p>

And laſtly, whether you have an eye to the recompence of reward in the other world, without reflexion upon any ſecular advantage in this life.</p>
                     <p>'Tis too common with men, to miſtake their own wills for the Will of God, their own Fancies for Divine Illumination, the love of themſelves for the Love of God, and the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of fleſh and bloud for the Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of God's holy Spirit.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. As the end of every Religious action is to be examined, whereby the equity or iniquity, ſincerity or hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy is diſcerned; ſo the care and caution, fervour and devotion of the heart in its performance, is to be conſidered:
<note place="margin">

And 'tis ſurely unreaſonable to imagine, that the all-ſeeing ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual God, or the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh, ſhould be pleaſed with any worſhip, or act of Religion, where the heart is not wholly intent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and devoted thereunto.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. After any holy action perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in publick, examine your own thoughts, whether they reflect not upon your own dextrous wit, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, elocution, zeal, or holineſs, for any of which you may expect to be praiſed and extolled by men. And though your heart be ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, as not to ſeek and hunt after popular applauſe; yet if you be affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and delighted with the praiſe of men, 'tis not without ſome tincture of vain-glory.</p>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:36977:65"/>and devotion in Pſalms and Hymns and ſpiritual Songs, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Praiers, and other the ſacred acts of Religious Worſhip: too often ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with my lips curſorily and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily, whilſt my heart hath been ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by evill imaginations and falſe ſuſpicions; judging raſhly of what is ſacred and holy, when tranſcending my ſhallow capacity.</p>
                     <p>I have ſinned by perverſe reaſonings againſt the Truth, becauſe either above my underſtanding, or not agreeable with my will; by conſenting, and not reproving the ſinfull; by not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the ignorant, not reducing the erroneous, not admoniſhing, not exhorting ſuch as have gone aſtray, to entertain more ſound and ſober counſells.</p>
                     <p>I have not reverenced my Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, I have both defamed and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed my Governours Eccleſiaſticall and Civil; neither have I repayed to my friends and benefactours ſuch gratefull acknowledgments and due obſequiouſneſs as becometh.</p>
                     <p>I have entertained in my heart ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny looſe and unchaſt thoughts and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy luſts; and have looked upon the carnal copulation and intermixture of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:36977:66"/>beaſts with an unclean delectation of mind.</p>
                     <p>I have been guilty of much ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and opprobrious language, of lying and ſlandering, of falſehoods and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, of railing and reviling, of ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous and vain jangling, of profane and irreligious ſpeaking, and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary ſwearing, of taking unlawfull oaths, of much filthy communication, and of all the evills of an untamed tongue, the inſtrument of a corrupt heart.</p>
                     <p>I have even renounced the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of my God, by not renouncing the Devil and all his works: I have too often yielded to his ſuggeſtions to diſobey the will of God, and to tranſgreſs his Commandments, in the breach of my Duty both towards God and Man.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have ſinned both in my thoughts and deſires, in my words and actions, by ſeeing, hearing, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, touching, ſmelling; even all my Senſes have been as ſo many win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows to let in Sin to my Soul, and Death by Sin.</p>
                     <p>And not onely thus, but in all kinds of Vice, whereunto humane frailty is liable, or in whatever any
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:36977:66"/>diſſolute and debauched perſon doth or can offend, have I offended the Great Lord of Heaven and earth. And I acknowledge my ſelf above all the men in the world to be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of Sinners.</p>
                     <p>Have mercy upon me, Almighty and moſt mercifull Father: for thy Son, my Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> his ſake, pardon and deliver me from all mine offences, confirm and ſtrengthen me in all goodneſs, and bring me to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> —</p>

                     <p n="2">2. In the right and reverent Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, with the devout and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Participation of this <hi>Sacramental Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> we are incorporated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his holy <hi>Myſtical Body.</hi> So ſaith our Lord himſelf; <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me, and I in him</hi>

                           <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.56.</note>. And ſuch is alſo the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Chriſt: If with a true penitent heart and lively faith we receive the Holy Sacrament, we ſpiritually eat the fleſh of Chriſt, and drink his bloud; we dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in us; we be one with Chriſt, and Chriſt with us; we obtain remiſſion of our Sins, and all other the Benfits of his Paſſion</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. Hence then it follows, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever owns the name of a Chriſtian and underſtands aright what it is to be

To uſe all poſſible means with his utmoſt endeavours to receive the ſame wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">I. As to the Firſt, whoſo ſlights or neglects to come, being invited, to the Holy Communion, either,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He rightly underſtands not the Holy Religion he profeſſeth: or,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. His Religion is no other but a bare Profeſſion; ſomething that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps employs his Tongue, and ſtrikes upon his Ears, to hear and talk about it; but never entred the deep of his Heart, truly to believe and practiſe it

                     <p>There be too many ſuch perſons, (God wot) that talk much of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, yea, many that talk loudly of Communion with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and are ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly zealous in the external perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of ſeveral Chriſtian Duties, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the frequency of long and loud Praiers: but if the many wild extravagancies of ſuch performances did not lay them open, yet their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral neglect of this Sacrament, which is the life and quinteſſence of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:36977:102"/>offices, and the infallible witneſs of true Chriſtianity, diſcovers the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy of ſuch ſeeming Zelots; that, with the old <hi>Phariſees, they draw nigh unto God with their mouth, and honour him with their lips; but their heart is not whole with him, neither are they ſtedfaſt in his covenant</hi>

Not to come to that Bleſſed Sacrament, being invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is to diſobey all theſe, and ſeveral more poſitive commands of God: which being alſo frequently read, heard, preached, and preſſed upon the conſciences of men by their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Miniſters, and yet ſtill ſlighted and diſobeyed, will undoubtedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur (if not prevented by a timely true Repentance and Amendment) that ſad and diſmall ſentence at the laſt Day, <hi>Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire</hi>

                     <p>The guilt of any which particulars is ſo inconſiſtent with the ſtate of true Chriſtianity, that there is no perſon who reads and ſeriouſly conſiders them, can reaſonably call himſelf a Member of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or acceptably call upon God as ſuch, and yet ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue his neglect of this Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And this amongſt others is one of the greateſt cauſes of ſo great a decay of Piety, of ſo much dulneſs and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart in all Religious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, of ſo much averſeneſs from the publick Worſhip of God in his Houſe of prayer, and of ſo much irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and profaneneſs therein. 'Tis the cauſe of ſo many ſpiritual diſeaſes in the Souls of men, of ſo much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt Temptations, of ſo much wavering in opinion, of ſo many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, Schiſms, Factions— even becauſe the Souls of all ſuch are not fed, nouriſhed, ſtrengthned and refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, quickned and confirmed with the precious Body and Bloud of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> the which, being rightly and reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received, illuminates the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:36977:103"/>purifies the Will, cleanſes the Heart, rectifies the Affections, and renders the whole Man apt and active to every good work of the Lord.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The Second general Duty in order to this Holy Sacrament is, <hi>To uſe all poſſible means and endeavours to receive the ſame worthily.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There will need no other Reaſons to enforce this Duty then the terrour of thoſe known words of the Apoſtle, <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> And this Unworthineſs conſiſts in <hi>not diſcerning the Lord's Body,</hi> as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows
<note n="m" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Here then every man that hath any care of his Soul will deſire to know what it is, <hi>not to diſcern the Lord's Body,</hi> which makes a man liable to Damnation, by being an unworthy Communicant at the Lord's Table.</p>
                     <p>To underſtand this fully and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we muſt uſe the light of a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For there is a threefold Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> abſtracted from that of his perſonal ſubſiſtence as Man of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Soul and humane Fleſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting: viz. 1. Myſtical, 2. Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, 3. Sacramental. And not to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:36977:104"/>diſcern the Lord's Body in any of theſe three meanings thereof, makes unworthie Receivers.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Myſtical</hi> Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is his Church

                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis one of the names whereby this Holy Sacrament is called, <hi>The Holy Communion;</hi> excluding thence as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy all that are not within the Pale and Communion of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Church, both Unbelievers and Misbelievers, Hereticks and Schiſmaticks; all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, factious, contentious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, with all ſorts of Separatiſts from the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whether in Faith or Charity, Doctrine or Worſhip.

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:36977:106"/>godly Sorrow for ſin, our holy Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and Reſolves of amendment, our Faith, our Hope, our Charity muſt be examined, that they be ſincere, and without hypocriſy. And therefore it is that this Duty is commanded by the Apoſtle, as if it were alone ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, when ſincerely performed, to make us acceptable Gueſts at the Lord's Table; ſaying, <hi>Let a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine himſelf, and ſo let him eat—</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4.

All this you would conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if you were going to the Palace of an earthly Prince, who is but a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man, like your ſelf: and you ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have much more reaſon to conſider theſe particulars now that you are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the Courts of the Lord's Houſe.</p>

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:36977:137"/>the relative Holineſs of this Houſe, and its eminency above other houſes, will appear by the Names whereby it is called both in the Book and by the People of God.</p>
                     <p>Under the Law it was called <hi>the Tabernacle of the congregation,</hi> i. e. the place of God's meeting with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <hi>the Temple of the Lord,</hi> where he preſents himſelf to the view of his people ſitting betwixt the Cherubims as on his Throne of ſtate.
